Subject: requesting permission to organise fundraising event

Dear Maâ€™am,

I, Gauri Chawla, studying in class 12, am writing to request permission to organise a fundraising event for the school's library renovation project. <br> As an avid reader and frequent visitor to the library, I am passionate about supporting this <br>initiative and would like to contribute in any way I can.

To make this event a success, I am hoping to work with a small team <br> of dedicated volunteers to plan and execute a bake sale in the school's <br> We plan to sell a variety of homemade baked goods, and all proceeds will go towards the library renovation project.
<br>

I have spoken with several members of the school's staff and have received positive feedback about this event. <br> I believe it would not only provide a fun opportunity for students to enjoy some delicious treats, but it would also help to raise much-needed funds for the library project.

Therefore, I am writing to request your approval for this event. I understand that there may be certain protocols and procedures that need to be followed, and I am willing to work with the school administration to ensure that everything is properly organised.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

Gauri Chawla
